#DON"T USE THE PLAYER PROMO CARDS FROM XMAGE! IT FREAKS OUT
#if you want promo cards, build your list in this format. It can handle them
#format is as below, any number of tabs is fine
#always put the name before the !, then the set code (if specific) before &,
#make sure both the ! and & signs are preceeded by at least one whitespace character
#then you may put a number or comment
#the script does not read it
Forest		!	PGRU	 &	4
Island		!	PGRU	 &	4
Plains		!	PGRU	 &	4
Swamp		!	PGRU	 &	4
Mountain	!	PGRU	& 	4
Aetherworks Marvel	!   4


#UPDATE: TOKEN SUPPORT NOW AUTOMATIC, FOLLOW THE BELOW STEPS ONLY IF YOU WANT TO ADD DIFFERENT EDITIONS OF TOKENS.
#this is done just like a normal card but with a few conditions:
#1. you must include which set the token comes from (on Scryfall it is done by prepending a T to the setcode)
#2. if there are duplicates within that set (such as eldrazi spawns 1-4), Prepend a | (pipe) to the collectors number and use that instead of the name, e.g. |4 for the 4th token
#This method will obtain the card, resize it, and appropriately print it in the printsheet
#KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO GET
#You are responsible for any tokens you cannot find on scryfall.com or that are not associated with the card version you picked.
#note tokens are obtained automatically for cards that were published with them.
